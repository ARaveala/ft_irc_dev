Run your program and test it with various passwords:

An empty password (./irc_program <port> "")

A password with only spaces (./irc_program <port> "    ")

A password that is too short (e.g., ./irc_program <port> "abc")

A password that is too long (e.g., ./irc_program <port> "ThisIsTooLongFor12Chars")

Passwords missing character types (e.g., ./irc_program <port> "onlyletters", ./irc_program <port> "12345678")

A password with internal whitespace (e.g., ./irc_program <port> "my secret")

A valid password (e.g., ./irc_program <port> "Pass_123!")
